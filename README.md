## Description
This project contains a webapp that hosts an iGPT model that I trained on MNIST. iGPT is an autoregressive transformer model that predicts the next pixel in an image given previous pixels. The architecture is similar to an LLM except the tokens correspond to pixels rather than characters.

The frontend is in HTML, CSS, and JS. The backend is in Python.
